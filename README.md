# Cocytus

**Cocytus** is an indie platformer with a twist:  
you move not with WASD, but with your **mouse**, using its position relative to the player to determine direction.

Built with 💜 for [Hack Club Juice](https://github.com/hackclub/juice) over the course of 2 months.

Playable on **web** via [Itch.io](https://idksarah.itch.io/wild-wild-wait-what)  
Steam build coming soon™
